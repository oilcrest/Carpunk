### üöÄ What's New

Carpunk is an advanced CAN Injection Toolkit, evolving from the original CANghost. It introduces new functionalities, including interface control, basic sniffing, and CAN Injection vulnerabilities.

- ‚úÖ Compatible with both Simulation & Real Cars
- üõ†Ô∏è Added Two New CAN Injection Attacks
- üß™ Tested on Ubuntu and Parrot OS

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes Before Running Carpunk

- **CAN Driver Loading**: Ensure your CAN bus driver is loaded manually. The script only manages the interface's up/down state.
- **Interface Argument**: Pass your CAN bus interface as an argument when running the script.
- **Log Files**: Logs are named sequentially (e.g., `carpunk1.log`, `carpunk2.log`). Restarting the script will overwrite `carpunk1.log`. Backup your logs accordingly.
- **Disclaimer**: Use this toolkit responsibly. The author is not liable for any damage or illegal activities resulting from its use.
